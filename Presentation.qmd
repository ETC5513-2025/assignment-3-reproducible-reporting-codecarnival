# Problem introduction

✈ **Airline Fare Pricing & Route Efficiency**

The airline industry shows big differences in fare prices, shaped by:

-   Route efficiency
-   Flight characteristics

This study explores:

-   💡 Does higher circuity (more indirect paths) mean **higher fare per mile**?
-   💡 Are **nonstop flights** more expensive than flights with stopovers?

Understanding these patterns helps explain airline pricing strategies and sets realistic fare expectations for travelers.

# Dataset description

-   📦 **Source:**\
    US Department of Transportation — Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)

-   🗂 **Size:**\
    1,581,278 rows × 26 columns

-   🔍 **Key variables:**

    -   Route features (circuity, nonstop miles)\
    -   Flight details (carrier, roundtrip, market share)\
    -   Competition (market HHI, LCC presence, multi-airport)

-   💡 **Datasets included:**\
    DB1B + T-100 (cleaned + merged)

# Methods

-   **Data:** Airline Market Fare Prediction

-   Calculated fare per mile for each itinerary

-   **Grouped routes by:**

    -   *Circuity:* High vs Low (median split)

    -   *Flight type:* Nonstop vs With Stops (Non_Stop column)

-   Summarized mean fare per mile for all groups

-   Visualized results with summary table and violin plot

# Results

::::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
-   **Nonstop, low circuity flights:** highest fare per mile (**0.247**)
-   **High circuity, with stops:** higher fare (**0.173**) than low circuity, with stops (**0.161**)
-   No nonstop flights in high circuity group
-   Plot highlights clear pricing patterns

    Fare_per_mile = Average_Fare / MktMilesFlown,
    CircuityGroup = ifelse(Circuity > median(Circuity, na.rm = TRUE), "High", "Low"),
    StopType = ifelse(Non_Stop == 1, "Nonstop", "With Stops")
  )

ggplot(MarketFarePredictionData, aes(x = CircuityGroup, y = Fare_per_mile, fill = StopType)) +
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE, alpha = 0.8) +

    x = "Circuity Group",
    y = "Fare per Mile",

# Conclusions

:::: columns
::: {.column width="65%"}
-   ✈️ **Nonstop, low-circuity flights** have the **highest fare per mile** — travelers pay more for speed and convenience.
-   🔁 **Higher circuity** (indirect) routes cost **more per mile**, even when they include stopovers.
-   🚫 **No nonstop flights** exist in high-circuity routes — airlines avoid inefficient direct paths.

📌 **Key Insight**\
Fare pricing reflects both **route efficiency** and **flight type**.\
Stopovers don’t always reduce fares — especially on inefficient routes.

# Recommendations

::: {.column width="60%"}
📢 **Practical Guidance:**

-   💰 **Budget travelers** → choose **low-circuity routes with stopovers** for best value.
-   ✈️ **Airlines** → use circuity data to refine **pricing and route planning**.
-   📊 **Analysts** → investigate **market share**, **LCC presence**, and **multi-airport markets** as additional drivers of fare differences.
