# Problem introduction

✈ **Airline Fare Pricing & Route Efficiency**

The airline industry shows big differences in fare prices, shaped by:

-   Route efficiency
-   Flight characteristics

This study explores:

-   💡 Does higher circuity (more indirect paths) mean **higher fare per mile**?
-   💡 Are **nonstop flights** more expensive than flights with stopovers?

Understanding these patterns helps explain airline pricing strategies and sets realistic fare expectations for travelers.

# Dataset description

-   📦 **Source:**\
    US Department of Transportation — Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)

-   🗂 **Size:**\
    1,581,278 rows × 26 columns

-   🔍 **Key variables:**

    -   Route features (circuity, nonstop miles)\
    -   Flight details (carrier, roundtrip, market share)\
    -   Competition (market HHI, LCC presence, multi-airport)

-   💡 **Datasets included:**\
    DB1B + T-100 (cleaned + merged)

# Methods

-   **Data:** Airline Market Fare Prediction (DB1B dataset)

-   Calculated fare per mile for each itinerary

-   **Grouped routes by:**

    -   *Circuity:* High vs Low (median split)

    -   *Flight type:* Nonstop vs With Stops (Non_Stop column)

-   Summarized mean fare per mile for all groups

-   Visualized results with summary table and violin plot

# Results

::::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
-   **Nonstop, low circuity flights:** highest fare per mile (**0.247**)
-   **High circuity, with stops:** higher fare (**0.173**) than low circuity, with stops (**0.161**)
-   No nonstop flights in high circuity group
-   Table and plot highlight clear pricing patterns

# Conclusions and/or recommendations

-   ✈️ **Nonstop, low-circuity flights** have the **highest fare per mile** — travelers pay more for speed and convenience.
-   🔄 **Higher circuity** routes (indirect paths) tend to cost **more per mile**, even with stopovers.
-   🚫 No nonstop flights exist in high-circuity routes — airlines avoid inefficient direct paths.

📌 **What this means**

-   Fare pricing reflects both **route efficiency** and **flight type**.
-   **Stopovers** don’t always lead to cheaper fares if the route is highly indirect.

📢 **Recommendations**

-   💰 Budget-conscious travelers: prefer **low-circuity routes with stopovers**.
-   🧭 Airlines: use circuity and stopover data to **optimize route planning and pricing**.
-   📊 Analysts: explore **other drivers** of fare variability (e.g., market share, LCC presence).
