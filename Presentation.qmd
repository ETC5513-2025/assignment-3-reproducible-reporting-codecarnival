# Problem introduction
âœˆ **Airline Fare Pricing & Route Efficiency**

The airline industry shows big differences in fare prices, shaped by:

* Route efficiency
* Flight characteristics

This study explores:

* ðŸ’¡ Does higher circuity (more indirect paths) mean **higher fare per mile**?
* ðŸ’¡ Are **nonstop flights** more expensive than flights with stopovers?

Understanding these patterns helps explain airline pricing strategies and sets realistic fare expectations for travelers.
