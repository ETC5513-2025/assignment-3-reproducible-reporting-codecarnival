# Problem introduction
✈ **Airline Fare Pricing & Route Efficiency**

The airline industry shows big differences in fare prices, shaped by:

* Route efficiency
* Flight characteristics

This study explores:

* 💡 Does higher circuity (more indirect paths) mean **higher fare per mile**?
* 💡 Are **nonstop flights** more expensive than flights with stopovers?

Understanding these patterns helps explain airline pricing strategies and sets realistic fare expectations for travelers.


# Dataset description
- 📦 **Source:**  
  US Department of Transportation — Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)

- 🗂 **Size:**  
  1,581,278 rows × 26 columns

- 🔍 **Key variables:**  
  - Route features (circuity, nonstop miles)  
  - Flight details (carrier, roundtrip, market share)  
  - Competition (market HHI, LCC presence, multi-airport)

- 💡 **Datasets included:**  
  DB1B + T-100 (cleaned + merged)


# Methods
- **Data:** Airline Market Fare Prediction (DB1B dataset)

- Calculated fare per mile for each itinerary

- **Grouped routes by:**

  - *Circuity:* High vs Low (median split)

  - *Flight type:* Nonstop vs With Stops (Non_Stop column)

- Summarized mean fare per mile for all groups

- Visualized results with summary table and violin plot

# Results

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
- **Nonstop, low circuity flights:** highest fare per mile (**0.247**)
- **High circuity, with stops:** higher fare (**0.173**) than low circuity, with stops (**0.161**)
- No nonstop flights in high circuity group
- Table and plot highlight clear pricing patterns
